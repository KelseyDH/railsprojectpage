== README

Rails project management website.

Built with <b><i>Ruby on Rails</i></b>, with a little help from my friend Bootstrap.  Database handled with <b><i>Postgresql</i></b>, rather than <i>SQLite3.</i>

Current pages include <tt>contact</tt>, <tt>about</tt> and <tt>home</tt>.

Database integration coming soon...
